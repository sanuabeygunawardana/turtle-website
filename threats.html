            <h1>Threats to turtles</h1>

                <p>Six of the seven species of sea turtles are considered threatened or endangered
                 around the globe as a result of human behavior and way of life. There are many ways 
                 that people harm these creatures, from people catching them with fishing gear to
                 people consuming their flesh and eggs.</p>

                 <p>Sea turtles are tough creatures. They have swum the waters since dinosaurs walked
                     the earth, protected by special body armor from their natural foes. But in recent
                      years, rapidly expanding human populations have led to fresh, intense pressures,
                       making it harder than ever for sea turtles to survive.</p>

            <h2><u>5 major threats to turtles</u></h2>

            <div class="threat-01">

                <h4>Fisheries bycatch</h4>

                <img src="images/turtle bycatch.jpg">

                <p>Thousands to tens of thousands of sea turtles are said to perish each year as a result 
                    of the fishing business. Turtles caught in gill nets, trawls, and longlines are discarded 
                    as bycatch. Additionally, the disturbance to their food source and environment has an effect 
                    on those that are able to evade fishing nets.
                </p>

            <div class="threats-02">

                <h4>Coastal development</h4>

                <img src="images/coastal development.jpg">

                <p>The habitats of sea turtles are being lost every year as a result of receding coasts. 
                    Every time a new hotel or high-rise is constructed close to the shore, whenever the
                   sea bottom is dug up, and whenever the beach erodes, sea turtle food sources and nesting
                    grounds suffer greatly.
                </p>

            </div>

            <div class="threats-03">

                <h4>Pollution and pathogens</h4>

                <img src="images/pollution.jpg">

                <p>Sea turtles are frequently harmed by marine pollution. Sea turtles are injured by
                    ingestion and entanglement due to plastic pollution, fishing gear left behind,
                     petroleum byproducts, and other debris. In addition to disrupting nesting behavior
                     and hatchling orientation, ocean pollution can impair the turtles' immune systems.

                <h4>Direct take</h4>

                <img src="images/direct take.jpg">

                <p>Turtles are murdered all over the world and sold as unusual food, oil, leather, and
                     jewelry on the international market. Millions of hawkbill turtles alone have been
                     slaughtered over the past century only for the value of their shells. Even while
                     efforts to promote conservation have resulted in a decline in the worldwide trade
                    in luxury and handicrafts, turtles continue to face danger in some regions of Africa
                     , Asia, and the Americas.

                <h4>Climate change</h4>

                <img src="images\climatic change.jpg">

                <p>The extent to which sea turtles can be impacted by climate change is only now coming to light.
                     Climate change has the potential to alter the natural sex ratios of hatchlings, raise
                      the risk of disease outbreaks, and increase the frequency of extreme weather conditions
                       that devastate coral reefs and beaches used for nesting.
